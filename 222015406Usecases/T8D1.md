# 1. Background, Problem Statement & Proposed Solution<br>
## 1.1. Introduction <br>
Having the most demanding work which could lead to you having less to no time to complete house chores, you then realise realize you need a domestic helper however you don't know any agencies near, what if there was a solution to all of this. The domestic work sector is faced with many challenges, the job accessibility, employer trust, and salary transparency and many more. Most skilled domestic workers are struggling   to secure the consistent employment or employment at all, this is while most of employers find it difficult to locate most qualified, vetted, and reliable domestic worker to cater for their needs. The hiring processes in this sector remains largely informal, leading to lot of inefficiencies and a lack of standardised employment terms. Domestic Assistants is a web and mobile-based recruitment platform which aims to solve this problem by providing structured job matching, a secure vetting system, salary transparency, and digital contract management. The platform ensures that both job seekers and employers will benefit from a streamlined, fair, and efficient recruitment process.<br>
## 1.2. Company and Industry Background<br>
Domestic Angels, was established in 2008, it is one of the leading placement agencies in South Africa, which is specialising in the recruitment of domestic worker. The company is providing services like the domestic staff placement, worker training, vetting and screening, employment contracts, and an Online Academy for upskilling the domestic workers. Operating in both Johannesburg and Cape Town, Domestic Angels has built a very strong reputation for professionalism and excellence in the recruitment space. Their experience and credibility make them the ideal sponsor for our third year project.<br>
## 1.3 Current System and Challenges<br>
As of now, the domestic workers are relying on word-of-mouth referrals and informal job-seeking methods to find the employment, this makes the employment opportunities inconsistent and unreliable. While the employers on the other hand, are struggling to verify the credentials of the worker, manage the salary expectations, and ensuring that they hire quality employees. Without a digital hiring system, the recruitment process remains time-consuming and inefficient. The lack of a well structured platform for both the job seekers and potential employers results in difficulty of finding qualified workers, a lack of job security for workers, and no easy way to set salary expectations and budgets.<br>
## 1.4 Problem Statement<br>
The domestic work industry is lackig a dedicated, digital recruitment platform that will connect the job seekers with employers in an efficient and transparent way. The current system used does not provide a structured selection process, an easy way to verify the workers, salary negotiation tools, or secure digital employment contracts.<br>
## 1.5 Proposed Solution<br>
Our project will act as one centralized digital marketplace where the employers would be able to  browse and filter the job seekers based on their skill, experience, and location, this is while workers would be able apply or accept job offers that match their salary expectations and availability. This platform will also include the secure vetting system, a function that will allow for acceptance and declining of job offer, employer would be able to set their budget, and an integrated contract and payment system*.Employers will be able to select candidates from a filtered list of pre-screened workers or post job requests that workers can apply for. Job seekers will have the ability to decline or accept job offers based on their salary expectations, job preferences, and availability. The system will ensure salary transparency by allowing both parties to see budgets and wage expectations beforehand. By implementing these features, Our project aims to increase employment accessibility for domestic workers, streamline the hiring process for employers, and introduce professionalism and trust into the domestic work sector.<br>
# 2. Requirements Extraction<br>
## 2.1 Functional Requirements<br>
Our project will be allow workers to create profiles, providing details such as work experience, salary expectations, and availability. Employers will be able to post job requests, set budgets, and browse through a filtered list of potential candidates. This system should feature an automated matching system that recommends workers based on job criteria while allowing workers to accept or decline offers. A vetting and background check system will ensure that only verified and qualified workers are listed. Our project will also introduce digital employment contracts*, a salary negotiation feature, and optional in-app payment processing* to create a secure and structured hiring experience.<br>
## 2.1 Non functional Requirements<br>
This must be secure, scalable, and user-friendly. Data encryption and authentication measures will protect user information. Real-time notifications will be there to enhance communication between employers and workers, and the user interface will be designed for an easy navigation, especially for non-tech users. To build trust, our project will have to provide clear salary breakdowns, verified user profiles, and an efficient dispute resolution process information eg. the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration(CCMA) details and processes available to jobseekers. The system might support multiple languages to accommodate the diverse domestic workforce in South Africa.

# 4. Feasibility and Risk Study
### 4.1 System Feasibility<br>
Similar platforms exist for corporate job recruitment, and those dedicated digital solution tailored specifically for domestic workers, like  Maid4u are overly complicated considering domestic workers are semi to unskilled workers, and literacy rates in this categories is most of times low. our project is a unique and necessary innovation, filling a significant gap in this job market.

### 4.2 Technical Feasibility
This software will be built as a web and mobile application, using modern development frameworks such as React. And might use machine learning algorithms which will assist with intelligent job matching and recommendations.

### 4.3 Economic Feasibility
Our project is financially viable and scalable. Because revenue will be generated through the premium job postings, employer will have to take subscription plans, and it can also be generated using commission-based payment processing. Also partnering with recruitment agencies like Domestic Angels, our project can ensure that we are sustainability in long term and credible in our industry.

### 4.4 Operational Feasibility
Having the Domestic Angels' expertise in screening, training, and placement, our project will be benefitting from a well-established recruitment company with best practices. The system will be designed for ease of use, ensuring that both employers and job seekers can navigate the platform efficiently.
